### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Anastasia Shchegol, junior Frontend Developer. 

I like to learn things from scratch, so I spend a lot of time studying vanilla JS. 

I'm highly interested in the field of digital accessibility. The prospect of enriching the internet's value and its ease of use for a wider array of users motivates me. Moreover, this presents an intriguing challenge for me as a developer.

And I love dogs.
